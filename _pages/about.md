My name is Diarra. I am a PhD student at Laval University under the supervision of <a href="https://www.pascalgermain.info/">Pascal Germain</a>. The subject of my thesis is deriving theoretical guarantees for deep learning models, with a focus on deep generative models. In my work, I use tools from statistical learning theory, mainly PAC-Bayesian theory. 

My research interests include:
* Statistical Learning Theory
* Deep Generative Models
* Variational Inference
* Neural Network Compression

Although most of my work has been fairly theoretical, I am eager to apply my knowledge to solve practical problems. I am currently looking for industry positions.
